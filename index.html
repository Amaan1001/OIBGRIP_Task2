        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>  15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. As a young scientist in DRDO, Kalam was assigned his first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’s defense applications. After several days of hard-work, he and his team were successful in developing India’s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. He was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts and thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
